# Unit 5

## Overview

Introduce this topic to students in a couple of paragraphs. Tell the students why this topic is important and what they are going to do. This is your opportunity to hook them into the unit so give the students something of interest.

## Resources

What are the resources that students will be using? This is where we will place the links to the journal articles. The idea of this section is that students can quickly see everything they need to complete the module learning activities

## Learning Activities

Learning Activities are the ungraded things that students do to. They include:

* Read
* Watch 
* Post / Discuss
* Perhaps others
