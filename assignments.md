## **My leadership story**

Due end of Week 8

In the transformational leadership model we learn how important it is for a leader to articulate his or her vision to others. One way of doing that is through sharing stories and personal anecdotes.

This assignment asks you to develop a story that you can take with you into future leadership situations.

Some questions to prompt reflection and recognition:

What people have had a significant impact on your life and why?

What hardships have you faced and overcome?

What are the greatest blessings in your life?

What do you really, really believe?

What ideas make your heart skip a beat?

What do you know about life now that you wish you had known in high school?

What is the one best piece of advice you could give to a person?

What life lesson would you like to pass on to your children some day?

If you only had one year left to live, how would you spend it?

Think beyond clichés \(e.g. Love makes the world go ‘round\) to insights that are unique to you. How might others benefit from hearing this story and your personal connection to it? How does this story point to your vision as a leader?

I am drawn to stories, as the consumer and the teller. I am drawn to storytellers impacting the communities they live in and role-modeling for generations to come. Deepa Kiran is a pioneering Indian storyteller, dancer, artist, author and mother of two boys \(Nair, 2016\).She has presented at Tedx and an international festival in Iran, and speaks nine languages \(Nair, 2016\).She is a pioneer in storytelling workshops for adults – reminding them of their forgotten and inner storyteller and guiding them back to the creativeness of their childhood \(Nair, 2016\). Kiran’s connection of our forgotten inner-child storytelling talent is connected to resilience. Have we ever wondered how children can be so resilient? It might be because wonder is most potent when we are young. In mindfulness practice, students are taught to reacquaint themselves with a beginner’s eye, a childlike curiosity we discard around 9 years old. As the insulation of childhood erodes, so does our degree of wonder. “There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle \(Einstein, n.d.\)”. Perhaps telling stories as adults will remind us to wonder more – and strengthen our resilience in the process?

Another poignant reason to share your story as part of your leadership practice is provided here:

“You tell me your story. I listen to you. I come to know your name and your suffering. It is at this point that a communion of hearts occurs, when I become vulnerable to you. There is no more superior and inferior. We are bound together in a covenant. My heart is transformed. This is a moment of wonder” \(p. 262\).  _Spink, K. \(2006\). The miracle, the message, the story: Jean Vanier and L'Arche. London: HiddenSpring_

 This is how we build understanding, eliminate false dichotomies, and connect to the humanity of those we view as different from us. In recent months, Manitoba has made international headlines for the number of refugees crossing the border in to Canada. Judgement abounds over the validity of these refugee claims. There was a man from the border town who adamantly opposed the idea of allowing asylum seekers to enter Canada in this way, until he opened his front door to head to work one morning and saw a family of five shivering, hungry and disoriented asking for assistance. He invited them in, listened to their story, and his heart was transformed. When we listen to another’s story, learn their name and their suffering our hearts are transformed. This is the vision for communion and community that as transformational servant leaders we seek to establish.
