# Unit 2

## Overview

Introduce this topic to students in a couple of paragraphs. Tell the students why this topic is important and what they are going to do. This is your opportunity to hook them into the unit so give the students something of interest. 

## Resources

What are the resources that students will be using? This is where we will place the links to the journal articles. The idea of this section is that students can quickly see everything they need to complete the module learning activities

## Learning Activities

Learning Activities are the ungraded things that students do to. They include: 

* Read
* Watch 
* Post / Discuss
* Perhaps others



Learning Activity \#1 - Read Northouse chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and complete the surveys for each chapter for your own information.

Tell students why you chose to include this material in the course and given them something to do Eg. While reading/watching think about these questions:



Repeat for other Learning Activities



## Assessment 

This is where a description and instructions for any graded work would go. 

Eg. Prepare a 100 word precis or synthesis of the document and post to forum.





Prepare and post a 250-300 word precis or synthesis commenting on the overall results of these surveys. Do they align with your self-conception or not? Did you have any revelations or new information to consider? Did anything challenge you with respect to the results?
