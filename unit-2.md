# Unit 2

Read Northouse chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and complete the surveys for each chapter for your own information. 

Prepare and post a 250-300 word precis or synthesis commenting on the overall results of these surveys. Do they align with your self-conception or not? Did you have any revelations or new information to consider? Did anything challenge you with respect to the results?
