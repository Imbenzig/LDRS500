Read Northouse chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and complete the surveys for each chapter for your own information. We will not be discussing or sharing in class. 

PREPARE AND SUBMIT A 250-300 WORD PRECIS COMMENT on the overall results of these surveys. Do they align with your self-conception or not? Did you have any revelations or new information to consider? Did anything challenge you with respect to the resuls?
