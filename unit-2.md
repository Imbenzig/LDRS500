## Overview

In week two our focus will be on historical and current models of leadership theory and practice to build competency in adaptability and change. Examining the roles of essential leadership, framework of assessing leadership, the role of innate qualities and characteristics in how they are integrated appropriately in leadership practices..

**Some of the learning outcomes in this week will include:**

1. Understanding and identifying the innate qualities and characteristics possessed by great leaders which allow for insights into differentiation on specific traits that sets them apart from followers.
2. Gaining insights into why possessing the right skills are essential in enabling a leader to work effectively with subordinates, peers, and superiors to accomplish the organizations goals.
3. Realization that style approach provides a framework for assessing leadership in a broad way reminding servant-leaders that their actions towards others occur on a task level and a relationship level.
4. Understanding that leadership is composed of both directive and a supportive dimension which in essence show effective servant-leaders recognizing what employees need and then adapting their own style to meet those needs

## Learning Activities

Read  the three listed journal articles above and also read Northouse chapters 2, 3, 4, 5 and complete the surveys for each chapter. Please find a copy of the survey assessments below in this section.

_**Leadership Trait Questionnaire \(LTQ\)**_

Organizations use a wide variety of questionnaires to measure individuals’ personality characteristics. In many organizations, it is common practice to use standard personality measures such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. These measures provide valuable information to the individual and the organization about the individuals’ unique attributes for leadership and where the individual could best serve the organization.

In this section, the Leadership Trait Questionnaire \(LTQ\) is provided as an example of a measure that can be used to assess your personal leadership characteristics. The LTQ quantifies the perceptions of the individual leader and selected observers, such as subordinates or peers. It measures an individual’s traits and points the individual to the areas in which that individual may have special strengths or weaknesses. By taking the LTQ, you can gain an understanding of how trait measures are used for leadership assessment. You can also assess your own leadership traits.

_**Leadership Instrument**_

Many questionnaires assess an individuals’ skills for leadership. A quick search of the Internet provides a host of these questionnaires. Almost all of them are designed to be used in training and development to give people a feel for their leadership abilities. Surveys have been used for years to help people understand and improve their leadership style, but most questionnaires are not used in research because they have not been tested for reliability and validity. Nevertheless, they are useful as self-help instruments because they provide specific information to people about their leadership skills.

In this chapter, we present a comprehensive skills model that is based on many empirical studies of leaders’ skills. Although the questionnaires used in these studies are highly reliable and are valid instruments, they are not suitable for our more pragmatic discussion of leadership in this text. In essence, they are too complex and involved. For example, Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al. \(200\) used measures that included open-ended responses and very sophisticated scoring procedures. Though critically important for validating the model, these complicated measures are less valuable as self-instruction questionnaires.

A skills inventory is provided in the next section to assist you in understanding how leadership skills are measured and what your own skills might be. Your scores on the inventory will give you a sense of your own leadership competencies. You may be strong in all three skills, or you may be stronger in some skills than others. The questionnaire will give you sense of your own skills profile. If you are stronger in one skill and weaker in another, this may help you determine where you want to improve in the future.

_**Style Questionnaire**_

Researchers and practitioners alike have used many different instruments to assess the styles of leaders. The two most commonly used measures have been the LBDQ \(Stogdill, 1963\) and the Leadership Grid \(Blake & McCanse, 1991\). Both of these measures provide information about the degree to which a leader acts task directed or people directed. The LBDQ was designed primarily for research and has been used extensively since the 1960s. The Leadership Grid was designed primarily for training and development; it continues to be used today for training managers and supervisors in the leadership process.

To assist you in developing a better understanding of how leadership style is measured and what your own style might be, a leadership style questionnaire is included in this section. This questionnaire is made up of 20 items that assess two orientations: task and relationship. By scoring the style questionnaire, you can obtain a general profile of your leadership behavior.

_**The essence of leadership**_

The essence of leadership is the process of influencing people, within a group with the attention toward a common goal. \(Northouse p 5,6\) What is the difference between leadership theory and values? Theories are research definitions and with measurable methodologies. Values are the key components that everyone agrees are essential to effective leadership

In their book Understanding research: A consumer’sGuide, Plano Clark and Creswell define theory as something that “explains andpredicts the probable relationship among different concepts \(variables\)” \(PlanoClark & Creswell, 2015, p. 490\). We could regard that is part of the learning process. If we poke this object with a stick in the side it should move that way. Theories are made by researchers and proven and disproven through experiments and reported to us in research studies.

The Oxford dictionary defines “\( values \) Principles or standards of behavior; one’s judgement of what is important in life” \([http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/value?q=values\#value\_\_9\).This](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/value?q=values#value__9%29.This) would be the learning outcome or the end result of a theory that is tested and true.

_**What forms can leadership take?**_

Northouse states that leadership takes many forms from liaise-faire to transformational \(p190\). The liaise-faire approach can be defined as hands off, distance or leadership through avoidance. Transactional is management by exception \(active or passive\), contingent reward etc. The final form which we will aspire to is transformational leadership.

As we read peer reviewed literature we can take these learned theories and put them into practice. When we put theory into practice it will transform our values. This would be the goal of Transformational Leadership. Giroux \(2014\) suggests, there may be some days where the servant leader could be accused of laissez-faire leadership.  When we know the rationale behind his/her decisions, however, we gain a better understanding of the why behind engagement of laissez-faire.  Author, Rakesh Wadhhwa \(n.d.\) blogs about the oxymoron in the term laissez-faire leadership and in fact, points out some of its benefits’ that could be seen to encompass some of the goals of transactional and servant leadership:

* Instills a higher sense of responsibility among team members
* Exposes team members to tough business decisions, helping them to gain more experience and grow faster
* Keeps team members aware of and continuously working towards the larger picture
* Can bring out the best in members, encouraging greater innovation and out-of-the-box initiatives

_**Values-Based Leadership and Transformational Servant Leadership?**_

Values-based or ethical leadership is defined as "the demonstration of normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement and decision-making"

\(Brown, Trevino, & Harrison, 2005, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 11\)

Transformational servant leadership combines the transformational and servant leadership models, and is described by Spears \(2004, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 15-17\) as inclusive of 10 characteristics: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community.

Jesus embodies each of these characteristics, in ways too numerous to write in one forum posting. \(Pooley, 2014\) asserts that, he is the son of God, yet was born in human form so he could best understand the temptations, pains and fears that we go through \(listening, empathy\). Healing was one of his primary callings, physically as well as emotionally and spiritually. He connected closely to God to develop self and community awareness, including conceptualization and foresight to develop goals and how to achieve those goals. He was the steward of the earth, with the salvation of humanity entrusted to him. Not once was a person converted due to coercion, but through genuine persuasion of the goodness of God. Jesus was committed to the growth of people through the development of his disciples, and their responsibility to spread God's worth in culturally sensitive ways. All of this developed the everlasting Christian faith community.
