Overview



**Competence, Confidence and Navigating the Labyrinth of being a Woman in Leadership**



I credit Torild Skard, a psychologist, former Member of Parliament in Norway and Senior Researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs for inspiring me to use the metaphor of a labyrinth in my title: Competence, Confidence and navigating the labyrinth of being a woman in leadership.

In Women of power: Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide, Skard \(2014\) makes the point thata ‘glass ceiling’ is too simplistic; a labyrinth is more descriptive of the challenges that women in leadership face. During this unit you will read about this complex path to leadership for women and consider

·the research concerning gender and leadership styles,

·the current situation of women in leadership in different parts of the world,

·the obstacles encountered and

·how leaders can work towards leveling the playing field for men and women.

While the topic of women in leadership was virtually ignored until the 1970s, early research \(Day & Stogdill, 1972; Deaux, 1976; Dimarco &Witsitt, 1975; Kaley. 1971\) asserted that women were inferior to men and lacked skills and traits necessary for managerial success. Scholars started to ask ‘Can women lead?’ and opinions started to shift as people experienced women’s leadership in various organizations. A meta-analysis done two decades later by Eagly & Johnson \(1990\) found that Women were NOT found to lead in a more interpersonally oriented & less task-oriented manner than men in organizations. The only gender difference - women use a more **participative** or **democratic** style than men. The literature demonstrated that females were evaluated **unfavorably** when they used a directive or autocratic style \(stereotypically male\) and both female and male leaders were evaluated **favorably** when they used a democratic leadership style \(stereotypically feminine\).

Today of course there are many examples of successful women leaders and the current research have changed to“What are the leadership style and effectiveness differences between women and men?” and “Why are women starkly underrepresented in elite leadership roles?”

How can leaders level the playing field so that both women and men can have equal opportunities to make meaningful contributions in leadership? The culture in many North American organizations is changing. Gendered work assumptions are being challenged. There is increasing parity in domestic responsibilities and more women professionals and entrepreneurs. One practical way to reduce gender bias is to useadvanced analytics to screen resumes to identify and remove gender bias resulting in a more diversified pool of talent and higher-quality candidates overall. Bias training of hiring managers creates more awareness. In the field of education, thepower of literature and powerful female characters can be transformative.

The issue of gender equality in leadership needs to be addressed at the individual, interpersonal, organizational and societal levels. A more**androgynous conception**of leadership focusing on best practice is what is needed. How might leadersembrace the challenge? During the MA Lead program you have an opportunityto recognize your potential as a leader to transform the culture and spark social change, and be leaders who will work to achieve gender equality. Through education that builds competence and confidence women are mentored towards a leadership approach that is inclusive and transformative. It’s an approach that helps women find their voice and their style while focusing on issues that are relevant and about which they are passionate to make a difference. Once women gain in their competence and confidence they have what is needed to navigate the labyrinth of being a woman in leadership.

Learning Activities

**Learning Activity \#1 –**

MA Lead Assistant Professor Adrienne Castellon is researching the challenges that women in leadership face. You can help contribute to the research! One of your course readings for this unit is a compilation of data from BC women leaders and 2 from India. The goal is to reach a larger sample size of women from around the globe. With that goal in mind, one of the learning activities for this unit is to participate in this research. If you are a woman in leadership you can answer the three questions yourself. If you are not a woman in leadership, you need to interview someone who is. Please email [Adrienne.castellon@twu.ca](mailto:Adrienne.castellon@twu.ca) , provide your answers to the three research questions and a jpeg picture \(if the person gives permission to use for research purposes\). The answers to the questions are more important than the picture of course!

1. What is the greatest challenge you have faced or are facing as a woman in leadership?

2. What is something that you do that helps you to meet or deal with this challenge?

3. Do you have any other advice or encouragement for women in leadership?



**Learning Activity \#2**

Read the 3 brief case studies in Northouse chapter 15. Post a response to one of the case studies using the questions as guiding prompts.



**Learning Activity \#3**

Take the Gender-Leader Implicit Association test in Northouse chapter 15. Post a response in your blog about your results. Any surprises? To what in your socialization and experience might your attribute your results? What are your next steps to reduce your own gender bias and provide a more level playing field for others?
