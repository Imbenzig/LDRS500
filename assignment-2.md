**Let me tell you a story DUE JAN. 16 AND 20 15%**

In the transformational leadership model we learn how important it is for a leader to articulate his or her vision to others. One way of doing that is through sharing stories and personal anecdotes.

This assignment asks you to develop a story that you can take with you into future leadership situations. No technology to be used for this assignment please.

Some questions to prompt reflection and recognition:

What people have had a significant impact on your life and why?

What hardships have you faced and overcome?

What are the greatest blessings in your life?

What do you really, really believe?

What ideas make your heart skip a beat?

What do you know about life now that you wish you had known in high school?

What is the one best piece of advice you could give to a person?

What life lesson would you like to pass on to your children some day?

If you only had one year left to live, how would you spend it?

Think beyond clichés \(e.g. Love makes the world go ‘round\) to insights that are unique to you. How might others benefit from hearing this story and your personal connection to it? How does this story point to your vision as a leader?

You will have the opportunity to deliver a “**rough draft**” of a story in class on the fifth day of class, **Monday January 16th, 2017**. We will practice these early versions in small groups, get constructive feedback, and eventually hone each story so that it has drama or interest, and a clear point. At the end you should be able to say, “The reason I am telling this story today is…” and make the connection to a particular circumstance or need. **Stories should be 3-5 minutes long, but no more than 6 minutes**.

In the practice session, listeners should give the following feedback to each speaker:

What’s the most genuine moment in the story?

What information is unclear or missing?

What details have the most impact?

How well does the point of the story relate to you?

How could the application be stronger?

When would this story be useful to tell?

**Invictus Group Presentation  DUE TUES JAN. 17 10%**

The Movie Invictus encourages people to believe in themselves so that the organization can achieve. This is a noble quest and requires a leader who can not only see over the horizon but make what is over the horizon tangible. As a team leader, getting people to believe in themselves and the organization is at the heart of any transformative process.

What are the key lessons that the movie brings across? In Class presentation– Tues. Jan. 17 2017.

**INVICTUSFIVE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS**

The movie illustrates leadership competencies, character and commitment, with an emphasis on the commitment and leader character of Mandela and Pienaar. How does your own experiences in leadership roles and to what extent the framework of competencies, character and commitment resonates with your own beliefs or perceptions of leadership.

The movie focuses on two different leaders, that is, Mandela and Pienaar. The leadership framework is essential for both even though the respective tasks they perform, and the challenges they face, differ. Mandela is focused on societal change whereas Pienaar is tasked to prepare the team for exceptional performance. Similarly, expectations that we have of leaders in business organizations are different depending on their level in the organization. But, regardless of their level — and whether the organization is public or private, large or small, etc. — our experience is that the framework of competencies, character and commitment resonates. How we give meaning to the three elements of good leadership depends on a number of factors including leadership level, the challenges that leaders confront, organizational culture and a host of others.

What is perhaps most unique about Mandela’s character is that he exhibits so many different dimensions of character that are not as evident in other leaders, such as Transcendence, Temperance, Humanity and Humility. These have often been viewed as soft and a sign of weakness by many, but we see in Mandela the strength they bring. It is critical to note that virtues become vices in excess or deficiency and the character elements works together to support one another. It is precisely because Mandela has depth of character in Transcendence, Temperance, Humanity and Humility that provides the necessary support for Courage, Drive and Accountability, for example.

We see the development of character in Pienaar and his teammates. Character development is indeed a lifelong journey for all of us, and the possibilities to develop and exercise character reside in everyday opportunities.

The scrutiny to which we have subjected Mandela and Pienaar is similar to how the people we work for, or that we lead, make attributions about our competencies, character and level of commitment to the leadership role. This should be a reminder for all of us.
