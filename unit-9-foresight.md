Unit 9OverviewIn Unit 9 we turn our attention to Foresight and the traits of a successful value-based transformational servant leader. The fact that values-based transformational servant leaders have important moves to make such as casting vision, setting mission and strategy, developing values, etc. remains at the heart of transformational servant leadership. The purpose of this unit is to critically think through important roles that leaders have in guiding and developing people and organizations. Enable learners to critically think through organizations, how they function, and how leaders function within them. This unit builds competency in strategic thinking, planning and organizing, adaptability and change, ethics and values, innovation, team leadership and collaboration.ResourcesOrganizational Foresight and stewardshipSouthwestern Airlines (A) Stanford Business School Case HR1-AThe Role of Organizational Vision in Guiding Idea Generation within SME ContextsTransforming leadership: Achieving unparalleled excellenceLearning ActivitiesSpecific Learning Outcomes1.
