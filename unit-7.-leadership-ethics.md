# Unit 7

## Overview

In Unit \# 7 we turn our attention to an integrated approach in looking at issues that arise in leadership situations, while addressing the principles of ethical leadership, perspectives of ethical leadership from a value-based transformational servant leadership approach. This module builds competency in visioning, strategic thinking, innovation, and team leadership. Please review the MA Leadership Monograph and Competencies for continued study on how these all fit together.

## Resources

What are the resources that students will be using? This is where we will place the links to the journal articles. The idea of this section is that students can quickly see everything they need to complete the module learning activities

## Learning Activities

Learning Activities are the ungraded things that students do to. They include:

* Read
* Watch 
* Post / Discuss
* Perhaps others

Learning Activity \#1 - Watch video 'What is the most important question' at [https://youtu.be/YTHrKL1rh18?list=PL3fSda8lJVjSiqBfZ5aM6zDFF4dR1oMir](https://youtu.be/YTHrKL1rh18?list=PL3fSda8lJVjSiqBfZ5aM6zDFF4dR1oMir)

_Tell students why you chose to include this material in the course and given them something to do Eg. While reading/watching think about these questions:_

## Assessment

This is where a description and instructions for any graded work would go. Again ... individual posts or some sort of synthesis of the materials above.
