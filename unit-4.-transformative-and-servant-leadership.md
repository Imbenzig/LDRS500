# Unit 4

## Overview

Introduce this topic to students in a couple of paragraphs. Tell the students why this topic is important and what they are going to do. This is your opportunity to hook them into the unit so give the students something of interest.

## Resources

What are the resources that students will be using? This is where we will place the links to the journal articles. The idea of this section is that students can quickly see everything they need to complete the module learning activities

## Learning Activities

Learning Activities are the ungraded things that students do to. They include:

* Read
* Watch 
* Post / Discuss
* Perhaps others

Learning Activity \#1 - Read Northouse chapter and prepare a 200 word precis/synthesis. Post to forum.

_Tell students why you chose to include this material in the course and given them something to do Eg. While reading/watching think about these questions:_

Learning Activity \#2 Read posted articles by Parolini, Stone, Page and Wallace.  Prepare a 250-300 word precis. Post to forum.

Learning Activity \#3 Read characteristics of Servant Led organizations. Prepare a 1OO word precis/synthesis. Post to forum.

## Assessment

This is where a description and instructions for any graded work would go.

_Would there be separate posts for all readings. Or would we want students to identify the common threads and apply them to some sitution? _
