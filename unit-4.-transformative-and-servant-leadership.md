# **UNIT4 Transformative and Servant Leadership**

## **Overview**

Unit 4 focuses onunderstanding that theextent to which the leader is able to shift the primary focus of leadership from the organization to the follower is the distinguishing factor in classifying leaders as either transformational or servant leaders. The focus will beon the of Role Transformational and Servant –Leadership. Identifying the four major categories of potential differences between transformational leadership and Servant-Leadership which include; moral priorities, \(member\) development, focus of outcomes and Style of influence.Bass and Riggio \(2006\) mention that the emphases in transformational leadership fit “the needs of today’s work groups, who want to be inspired and empowered to succeed in times of uncertainty”. In other words, the needs of today’s work group are differing than previous generations and therefore need fresh research into a “New Leadership” paradigm.

Bass & Riggio \(2006\) in the book Transformational Leadership,states that transformational leaders not only consider the needs of their followers, but “transformational leadership can be seen when leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.” Leaders ensure that followers are satisfied on the job and have opportunities to be creative and innovative.Riggio suggests that the reason for the popularity of transformational leadership is because “it represents the changing nature of effective leadership as we now see it and know it in business, government, and social movements \(2006, p. 224\).As one part of transformational servant leadership, transformational leadership builds a foundation of empowerment and passion to move an organization forward through innovation. Servant leadership builds on the foundation with the aim to be “attentive to the concerns of their followers, empathize with them, and nurture them. Servant leaders put followers first, empower them, and help them develop their full personal capacities” \(Northouse, 2016\). It is within the distinctions that one can find a summary of what characteristics shape transformational servant leadership. A transformational servant leader must prioritize stimulating their followers to achieve extraordinary outcomes, as they serve the needs of their followers which will assist in each transformation in their leadership capacity.

## **Learning Activities**

Transformational leaders inspire and motivate followers to reach their fullest potential for the good of the organization \(Northouse, 2016\). Whereas servant leaders put followers first, empower them, and help them develop their full personal capacities” \(Northouse, 2016, p.225\). One would argue that to best serve individuals in a dynamic external environment, a leader must have a leadership style that deeply cares for employees’ needs and the organizational objectives. The co-mingling of both approaches is the best approach in that leaders must serve both interests” Transformational servant leadership would be an ideal style when faced with a dynamic external environment and endeavoring to empower, encourage innovation and risk-taking amongst the team members.

According to Quinn and Spreitzer \(1997\), empowered followers are more effective, more innovative, and are transformational in the work they do. When employees are empowered, they perform better and to their full potential to overcome obstacles. In traditional leadership, upper management issue instructions to their employees who are responsible to complete tasks according to guidelines. Comparably, transformational servant leaders empower and motivate their followers to think and act, which develops self-confidence.
